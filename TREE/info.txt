Traversal Methods:

Depth-First Search (DFS):
Preorder: Visit the root, then left subtree, then right subtree.
Inorder: Visit the left subtree, root, then right subtree (used in BST to get sorted order).
Postorder: Visit the left subtree, right subtree, then root.

Breadth-First Search (BFS):
Level Order: Visit nodes level by level, from left to right.
